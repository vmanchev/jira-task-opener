# Jira task opener

Quick and easy way to access your JIRA tasks.

## Purpose 

How many times you were working on a project and you need to open a task with a 
given number, e.g. PROJ-1234 code? To open Jira and search for the task could 
take some time, its JAVA-based after all. Or you relay on your browser history, 
search for the URL and replace the code?

How about using a shortcut, type the number and press enter?

## Options

1. Navigate to "More tools" -> "Extensions" -> "Jira task opener" -> "Options"
2. For each one of your projects, provide the project name, project code and the 
"browse" url (e.g. "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/").
3. Save and close. 

## How it works?

### Case #1
Click on the Jira icon, next to the browser address bar, select your project, 
type the task number and press Enter.

### Case #2
Almost the same, but this time you can use a handy shortcut - ALT+J
